# alarm_clock
For this project I designed an alarm clock and implemented it into a PCB layout. The alarm clock operates off of an Arduino Uno microcontroller and is capable of displaying time in 24-hour format on 7-segment LEDâ€™s. The file push_button_counter.cpp is a progression of the final code for the alarm clock itself.
